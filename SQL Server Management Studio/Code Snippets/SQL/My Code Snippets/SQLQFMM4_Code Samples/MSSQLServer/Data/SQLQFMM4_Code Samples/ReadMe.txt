You can find sample files containing data and the queries mentioned
in each chapter for the nine sample databases: 

  - Bowling League
  - Bowling League Modify
  - Entertainment Agency

---------------------------
Installing the Sample Files
---------------------------

WINDOWS 
-------

To install the sample files on a Microsoft Windows system (Microsoft Windows
7 or later recommended), use Windows Explorer to extract the sample files 
from the file you dowload from http://www.informit.com/title/9780134858333.  
You need 425 MB of free space to install the sample files.  If you plan to 
use Microsoft SQL Server and directly attach the .mdf and .ldf files instead
of building them from scratch from the supplied scripts, be sure to unzip
the samples to your C drive. You cannot attach the files if you unzip the
files to your Documents folder.

You can download and install a free copy of MySQL from http://www.MySQL.com.

You can download and install a free copy of Microsoft SQL Server Express
edition from 
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express.

You can download and install a free copy of PostgreSQL from
https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads.

The sample files are provided in the following formats:

1) Microsoft Office Access 2007 (.accdb) - subfolder MSAccess

2) Microsoft SQL Server 2016 (.mdf, .ldf) - subfolder MSSQLServer\Data

3) Microsoft SQL Server 2016 scripts (.sql) - subfolder MSSQLServer\SQLScripts

4) MySQL Version 5.7 scripts (.sql) - subfolder MySQL\SQLScripts

5) PostgreSQL Version 9.6.3 scripts (.sql) - subfolder PostgreSQL\SQLScripts

6) Images of the database schemas (.jpg) - subfolder Relationships

7) Schemas as a "dictionary" (.xlsx) - subfolder Schemas


MAC OS X
--------
To install the MySQL files on Mac OS X, follow these steps:

1) Dowload the sample files from 
   http://www.informit.com/title/9780321992475

2) Use Finder to decompress the zip file.

      =======================================================
      Note: 
      You can download a free copy of MySQL or PostgreSQL
      using the links above.
      You can use the scripts you find in the MySQL\SQLSCripts 
      or PostgreSQL\SQLScripts folders to define the databases,
      load the sample data, and define the Views and Stored 
      Procedures / Functions in MySQL or PostgreSQL.
      If, however, you are running Windows under 
      Boot Camp or with Parallels, you can also use the 
      Microsoft Office Access and Microsoft SQL Server
      files when running Windows on your Intel Mac.
      =======================================================

NOTE: You can open any of the Microsoft Access files with Microsoft Access 2007 
(Version 12) or later.


-----------------
MSSQLServer FILES
-----------------

You can find four types of files in the MSSQLServer\Data folder:

1) SQL Server Data files (.mdf) - These files contain the tables, views, and stored
proceures for each of the sample databases.  You must attach the data file and its
companion log file to SQL Server to be able to use them.

2) SQL Server Log files (.ldf) - These files contain the log data for each of the 
sample databases.  You must attach the data files to SQL Server to be able to use them.

NOTE: You need Microsoft SQL Server 2016 or later to use these files.
You can download a free copy of Microsoft SQL Server Express from
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/editions/2012-editions/express.aspx

To attach the files directly (provided you unzipped to your C: drive), run
SQL Server Management Studio, open a New Query, and execute commands like this:

USE master;  
GO  
CREATE DATABASE BowlingLeagueExample   
    ON (FILENAME = 'C:\SQLQFMM4\Samples\MSSQLServer\Data\BowlingLeagueExample.mdf'),  
    (FILENAME = 'C:\SQLQFMM4\Samples\MSSQLServer\Data\BowlingLeagueExample_log.ldf')  
    FOR ATTACH;  
GO  

NOTE: You may need to modify the permissions to your C drive if you're using Windows 10
so that your login ID has permission to write to and create folders in the root of
your boot drive.

Simply copy and paste the above, changing the database file names for each database
that you want to attach.

You can also build Microsoft SQL Server files using the scripts found in
MSSQLServer\SQLScripts:
